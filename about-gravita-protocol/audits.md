# Audits

### Smart Contract Auditors

> ⚠️ The following audits were originally performed on **[Gravita Protocol](https://docs.gravitaprotocol.com/)**.  
> Levra is a **100% fork** of Gravita, with only the protocol name changed (**Gravita → Levra**) and the DebtToken symbol updated (**GRAI → USDL**).  
> Therefore, all audit findings and their resolutions apply equally to Levra.
