# Token Overview

## What is USDL?

USDL is an over-collateralized debt token issued by Levra Protocol. USDL can be minted by depositing collateral on Levra Protocol.

### Hard price ceiling

USDL's Vessels' maximum LTV of 90% with WETH as a collateral creates a natural price ceiling at $1.10.&#x20;

When USDL exchange rate exceeds that level, borrowers can make an instant profit by borrowing the maximum amount against their collateral and selling USDL on the market for more than $1.10.&#x20;

If 1 USDL trades at $1.20 for example, you can lock up $2200 worth of the LST of your choice, take out a loan of 2000 USDL and sell it for $2400. No matter if your loans gets liquidated or not, you have made an arbitrage gain of $200.

### Hard price floor

The ability to redeem USDL for collateral creates a hard price floor, below which arbitrage opportunities become profitable.&#x20;

We call these "hard peg mechanisms" since they are based on direct processes.&#x20;
